# Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm

## Overview

Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm is an efficient algorithm for multiplying two matrices using a divide-and-conquer approach. It was introduced by Volker Strassen in 1969. The algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required for matrix multiplication compared to the standard method.

## Key Concepts

- **Divide and Conquer:** Strassen's algorithm divides each matrix into four submatrices, recursively multiplies these submatrices, and then combines the results to obtain the final product.

- **Matrix Splitting:**
  - Given matrices A and B are split into four submatrices: A11, A12, A21, A22, and B11, B12, B21, B22.
  
- **Intermediate Matrix Calculations:**
  - Seven recursive multiplications (P1 to P7) are calculated using the submatrices.
  
- **Combining Results:**
  - The intermediate results are combined to obtain the final product matrices.

## Advantages

- **Reduced Multiplications:** Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of multiplications from 8 to 7 compared to the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.

- **Complexity:** The algorithm exhibits a lower asymptotic complexity compared to the standard algorithm, making it particularly useful for large matrix sizes.

## Limitations

- **Addition Overhead:** While the number of multiplications is reduced, the algorithm introduces additional additions, which may impact performance for smaller matrices.

- **Practical Considerations:** For small matrix sizes, the standard algorithm might outperform Strassen's algorithm due to the constant factors involved in the additional operations.

## Code Structure

### Matrix Manipulation Functions

1. **`split_matrix(matrix)`**
   - Splits a matrix into four equal-sized submatrices (A11, A12, A21, A22).

2. **`add_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)`**
   - Adds two matrices element-wise.

3. **`subtract_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)`**
   - Subtracts one matrix from another element-wise.

### Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm

4. **`strassen(matrix1, matrix2)`**
   - Implements Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm using recursion.

### Random Matrix Generation

5. **`generate_random_matrix(rows, cols, seed=None)`**
   - Generates a random matrix with given dimensions, optionally accepting a seed for reproducibility.

### Benchmarking

6. **`benchmark(matrix_size, repetitions=5, warm_up_runs=3, seed=None)`**
   - Measures individual runtimes of Strassen's algorithm for a specified matrix size.
   - Performs warm-up runs for system stabilization.
   - Calculates average runtimes over multiple repetitions.
   - Stores benchmarking data in a Pandas DataFrame.

### Main Benchmarking Loop

7. **`matrix_sizes = [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]`**
   - List of matrix sizes to be benchmarked.

8. **`repetitions = 5`**
   - Number of repetitions for each matrix size.

9. **`all_data = pd.DataFrame()`**
   - Initializes an empty DataFrame to store benchmarking results.

10. **Loop through each matrix size:**

    - Also prints average runtimes for each matrix size.

## Observations

**Observation 1: Algorithm Efficiency**

Upon analyzing the benchmark results, we observe that Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm demonstrates efficient performance for smaller matrix sizes. As the matrix size increases, the algorithm maintains a reasonable runtime, showcasing its scalability.

**Observation 2: Logarithmic Trend in Runtimes**

The runtime vs. matrix size graph indicates a logarithmic trend, particularly visible when using a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. This suggests that the algorithm's complexity scales better than traditional matrix multiplication methods for larger matrices.
